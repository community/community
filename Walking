repo Manifest Format
A repo manifest describes the structure of a repo client; that is the directories that are visible and where they should be obtained from with git.

The basic structure of a manifest is a bare Git repository holding a single default.xml XML file in the top level directory.

Manifests are inherently version controlled, since they are kept within a Git repository. Updates to manifests are automatically obtained by clients during repo sync.

XML File Format
A manifest XML file (e.g. default.xml) roughly conforms to the following DTD:

<!DOCTYPE manifest [

  <!ELEMENT manifest (notice?,
                      remote*,
                      default?,

                      submanifest*?,
                      remove-project*,
                      project*,
                      extend-project*,
                      repo-hooks?,
                      superproject?,

For compatibility purposes across repo releases, all unknown elements are silently ignored. However, repo reserves all possible names for itself for future use. If you want to use custom elements, the x-* namespace is reserved for that purpose, and repo guarantees to never allocate any corresponding names.

A description of the elements and their attributes follows.

Element manifest
The root element of the file.

Element notice
Arbitrary text that is displayed to users whenever repo sync finishes. The content is simply passed through as it exists in the manifest.

Element remote
One or more remote elements may be specified. Each remote element specifies a Git URL shared by one or more projects and (optionally) the Gerrit review server those projects upload changes through.

Attribute name: A short name unique to this manifest file. The name specified here is used as the remote name in each project's .git/config, and is therefore automatically available to commands like git fetch, git remote, git pull and git push.

Attribute alias: The alias, if specified, is used to override name to be set as the remote name in each project's .git/config. Its value can be duplicated while attribute name has to be unique in the manifest file. This helps each project to be able to have same remote name which actually points to different remote url.

Attribute fetch: The Git URL prefix for all projects which use this remote. Each project's name is appended to this prefix to form the actual URL used to clone the project.

Attribute pushurl: The Git “push” URL prefix for all projects which use this remote. Each project's name is appended to this prefix to form the actual URL used to “git push” the project. This attribute is optional; if not specified then “git push” will use the same URL as the fetch attribute.

Attribute review: Hostname of the Gerrit server where reviews are uploaded to by repo upload. This attribute is optional; if not specified then repo upload will not function.

Attribute revision: Name of a Git branch (e.g. main or refs/heads/main). Remotes with their own revision will override the default revision.

Element default
At most one default element may be specified. Its remote and revision attributes are used when a project element does not specify its own remote or revision attribute.

Attribute remote: Name of a previously defined remote element. Project elements lacking a remote attribute of their own will use this remote.

Attribute revision: Name of a Git branch (e.g. main or refs/heads/main). Project elements lacking their own revision attribute will use this revision.

Attribute dest-branch: Name of a Git branch (e.g. main). Project elements not setting their own dest-branch will inherit this value. If this value is not set, projects will use revision by default instead.

Attribute upstream: Name of the Git ref in which a sha1 can be found. Used when syncing a revision locked manifest in -c mode to avoid having to sync the entire ref space. Project elements not setting their own upstream will inherit this value.

Attribute sync-j: Number of parallel jobs to use when synching.

Attribute sync-c: Set to true to only sync the given Git branch (specified in the revision attribute) rather than the whole ref space. Project elements lacking a sync-c element of their own will use this value.

Attribute sync-s: Set to true to also sync sub-projects.

Attribute sync-tags: Set to false to only sync the given Git branch (specified in the revision attribute) rather than the other ref tags.

Element manifest-server
At most one manifest-server may be specified. The url attribute is used to specify the URL of a manifest server, which is an XML RPC service.

See the smart sync documentation for more details.

Element submanifest
One or more submanifest elements may be specified. Each element describes a single manifest to be checked out as a child.

Attribute name: A unique name (within the current (sub)manifest) for this submanifest. It acts as a default for revision below. The same name can be used for submanifests with different parent (sub)manifests.

Attribute remote: Name of a previously defined remote element. If not supplied the remote given by the default element is used.

Attribute project: The manifest project name. The project‘s name is appended onto its remote’s fetch URL to generate the actual URL to configure the Git remote with. The URL gets formed as:

${remote_fetch}/${project_name}.git
where ${remote_fetch} is the remote‘s fetch attribute and ${project_name} is the project’s name attribute. The suffix “.git” is always appended as repo assumes the upstream is a forest of bare Git repositories. If the project has a parent element, its name will be prefixed by the parent's.

The project name must match the name Gerrit knows, if Gerrit is being used for code reviews.

project must not be empty, and may not be an absolute path or use “.” or “..” path components. It is always interpreted relative to the remote's fetch settings, so if a different base path is needed, declare a different remote with the new settings needed.

If not supplied the remote and project for this manifest will be used: remote cannot be supplied.

Projects from a submanifest and its submanifests are added to the submanifest::path:<path_prefix> group.

Attribute manifest-name: The manifest filename in the manifest project. If not supplied, default.xml is used.

Attribute revision: Name of a Git branch (e.g. “main” or “refs/heads/main”), tag (e.g. “refs/tags/stable”), or a commit hash. If not supplied, name is used.

Attribute path: An optional path relative to the top directory of the repo client where the submanifest repo client top directory should be placed. If not supplied, revision is used.

path may not be an absolute path or use “.” or “..” path components.

Attribute groups: List of additional groups to which all projects in the included submanifest belong. This appends and recurses, meaning all projects in submanifests carry all parent submanifest groups. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute default-groups: The list of manifest groups to sync if no --groups= parameter was specified at init. When that list is empty, use this list instead of “default” as the list of groups to sync.

Element project
One or more project elements may be specified. Each element describes a single Git repository to be cloned into the repo client workspace. You may specify Git-submodules by creating a nested project. Git-submodules will be automatically recognized and inherit their parent's attributes, but those may be overridden by an explicitly specified project element.

Attribute name: A unique name for this project. The project‘s name is appended onto its remote’s fetch URL to generate the actual URL to configure the Git remote with. The URL gets formed as:

${remote_fetch}/${project_name}.git
where ${remote_fetch} is the remote‘s fetch attribute and ${project_name} is the project’s name attribute. The suffix “.git” is always appended as repo assumes the upstream is a forest of bare Git repositories. If the project has a parent element, its name will be prefixed by the parent's.

The project name must match the name Gerrit knows, if Gerrit is being used for code reviews.

“name” must not be empty, and may not be an absolute path or use “.” or “..” path components. It is always interpreted relative to the remote's fetch settings, so if a different base path is needed, declare a different remote with the new settings needed. These restrictions are not enforced for Local Manifests.

Attribute path: An optional path relative to the top directory of the repo client where the Git working directory for this project should be placed. If not supplied the project “name” is used. If the project has a parent element, its path will be prefixed by the parent's.

“path” may not be an absolute path or use “.” or “..” path components. These restrictions are not enforced for Local Manifests.

If you want to place files into the root of the checkout (e.g. a README or Makefile or another build script), use the copyfile or linkfile elements instead.

Attribute remote: Name of a previously defined remote element. If not supplied the remote given by the default element is used.

Attribute revision: Name of the Git branch the manifest wants to track for this project. Names can be relative to refs/heads (e.g. just “main”) or absolute (e.g. “refs/heads/main”). Tags and/or explicit SHA-1s should work in theory, but have not been extensively tested. If not supplied the revision given by the remote element is used if applicable, else the default element is used.

Attribute dest-branch: Name of a Git branch (e.g. main). When using repo upload, changes will be submitted for code review on this branch. If unspecified both here and in the default element, revision is used instead.

Attribute groups: List of groups to which this project belongs, whitespace or comma separated. All projects belong to the group “all”, and each project automatically belongs to a group of its name:name and path:path. E.g. for <project name="monkeys" path="barrel-of"/>, that project definition is implicitly in the following manifest groups: default, name:monkeys, and path:barrel-of. If you place a project in the group “notdefault”, it will not be automatically downloaded by repo. If the project has a parent element, the name and path here are the prefixed ones.

Attribute sync-c: Set to true to only sync the given Git branch (specified in the revision attribute) rather than the whole ref space.

Attribute sync-s: Set to true to also sync sub-projects.

Attribute upstream: Name of the Git ref in which a sha1 can be found. Used when syncing a revision locked manifest in -c mode to avoid having to sync the entire ref space.

Attribute clone-depth: Set the depth to use when fetching this project. If specified, this value will override any value given to repo init with the --depth option on the command line.

Attribute force-path: Set to true to force this project to create the local mirror repository according to its path attribute (if supplied) rather than the name attribute. This attribute only applies to the local mirrors syncing, it will be ignored when syncing the projects in a client working directory.

Element extend-project
Modify the attributes of the named project.

This element is mostly useful in a local manifest file, to modify the attributes of an existing project without completely replacing the existing project definition. This makes the local manifest more robust against changes to the original manifest.

Attribute path: If specified, limit the change to projects checked out at the specified path, rather than all projects with the given name.

Attribute dest-path: If specified, a path relative to the top directory of the repo client where the Git working directory for this project should be placed. This is used to move a project in the checkout by overriding the existing path setting.

Attribute groups: List of additional groups to which this project belongs. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute revision: If specified, overrides the revision of the original project. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute remote: If specified, overrides the remote of the original project. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute dest-branch: If specified, overrides the dest-branch of the original project. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute upstream: If specified, overrides the upstream of the original project. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute base-rev: If specified, adds a check against the revision to be extended. Manifest parse will fail and give a list of mismatch extends if the revisions being extended have changed since base-rev was set. Intended for use with layered manifests using hash revisions to prevent patch branches hiding newer upstream revisions. Also compares named refs like branches or tags but is misleading if branches are used as base-rev. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Element annotation
Zero or more annotation elements may be specified as children of a project element, an extend-project element, or a remote element. Each element describes a name-value pair. For projects, this name-value pair will be exported into each project's environment during a ‘forall’ command, prefixed with REPO__. In addition, there is an optional attribute “keep” which accepts the case insensitive values “true” (default) or “false”. This attribute determines whether or not the annotation will be kept when exported with the manifest subcommand.

Element copyfile
Zero or more copyfile elements may be specified as children of a project element, or an extend-project element. Each element describes a src-dest pair of files; the “src” file will be copied to the “dest” place during repo sync command.

“src” is project relative, “dest” is relative to the top of the tree. Copying from paths outside of the project or to paths outside of the repo client is not allowed.

“src” and “dest” must be files. Directories or symlinks are not allowed. Intermediate paths must not be symlinks either.

Parent directories of “dest” will be automatically created if missing.

Element linkfile
It's just like copyfile and runs at the same time as copyfile but instead of copying it creates a symlink.

The symlink is created at “dest” (relative to the top of the tree) and points to the path specified by “src” which is a path in the project.

Parent directories of “dest” will be automatically created if missing.

The symlink target may be a file or directory, but it may not point outside of the repo client.

Element remove-project
Deletes a project from the internal manifest table, possibly allowing a subsequent project element in the same manifest file to replace the project with a different source.

This element is mostly useful in a local manifest file, where the user can remove a project, and possibly replace it with their own definition.

The project name or project path can be used to specify the remove target meaning one of them is required. If only name is specified, all projects with that name are removed.

If both name and path are specified, only projects with the same name and path are removed, meaning projects with the same name but in other locations are kept.

If only path is specified, a matching project is removed regardless of its name. Logic otherwise behaves like both are specified.

Attribute optional: Set to true to ignore remove-project elements with no matching project element.

Attribute base-rev: If specified, adds a check against the revision to be removed. Manifest parse will fail and give a list of mismatch removes if the revisions being removed have changed since base-rev was set. Intended for use with layered manifests using hash revisions to prevent patch branches hiding newer upstream revisions. Also compares named refs like branches or tags but is misleading if branches are used as base-rev. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Element repo-hooks
NB: See the practical documentation for using repo hooks.

Only one repo-hooks element may be specified at a time. Attempting to redefine it will fail to parse.

Attribute in-project: The project where the hooks are defined. The value must match the name attribute (not the path attribute) of a previously defined project element.

Attribute enabled-list: List of hooks to use, whitespace or comma separated.

Element superproject
Note: This is currently a WIP.

NB: See the git superprojects documentation for background information.

This element is used to specify the URL of the superproject. It has “name” and “remote” as atrributes. Only “name” is required while the others have reasonable defaults. At most one superproject may be specified. Attempting to redefine it will fail to parse.

Attribute name: A unique name for the superproject. This attribute has the same meaning as project's name attribute. See the element project for more information.

Attribute remote: Name of a previously defined remote element. If not supplied the remote given by the default element is used.

Attribute revision: Name of the Git branch the manifest wants to track for this superproject. If not supplied the revision given by the remote element is used if applicable, else the default element is used.

Element contactinfo
Note: This is currently a WIP.

This element is used to let manifest authors self-register contact info. It has “bugurl” as a required atrribute. This element can be repeated, and any later entries will clobber earlier ones. This would allow manifest authors who extend manifests to specify their own contact info.

Attribute bugurl: The URL to file a bug against the manifest owner.

Element include
This element provides the capability of including another manifest file into the originating manifest. Normal rules apply for the target manifest to include - it must be a usable manifest on its own.

Attribute name: the manifest to include, specified relative to the manifest repository's root.

“name” may not be an absolute path or use “.” or “..” path components. These restrictions are not enforced for Local Manifests.

Attribute groups: List of additional groups to which all projects in the included manifest belong. This appends and recurses, meaning all projects in included manifests carry all parent include groups. Same syntax as the corresponding element of project.

Attribute revision: Name of a Git branch (e.g. main or refs/heads/main) default to which all projects in the included manifest belong.

Local Manifests
Additional remotes and projects may be added through local manifest files stored in $TOP_DIR/.repo/local_manifests/*.xml.

For example:

$ ls .repo/local_manifests
local_manifest.xml
another_local_manifest.xml

$ cat .repo/local_manifests/local_manifest.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <project path="manifest"
           name="tools/manifest" />
  <project path="platform-manifest"
           name="platform/manifest" />
</manifest>
Users may add projects to the local manifest(s) prior to a repo sync invocation, instructing repo to automatically download and manage these extra projects.

Manifest files stored in $TOP_DIR/.repo/local_manifests/*.xml will be loaded in alphabetical order.

Projects from local manifest files are added into local:: group.

The legacy $TOP_DIR/.repo/local_manifest.xml path is no longer supported.

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Apache HTTP Server project must balance two competing and disjoint
objectives: maintain stable code for third party authors, distributors and
most importantly users so that bug and security fixes can be quickly adopted
without significant hardship due to user-visible changes; and continue the
development process that requires ongoing redesign to correct earlier
oversights and to add additional features.

The Apache HTTP Server, through version 2.0, used the Module Magic Number (MMN)
to reflect API changes.  This had the shortcoming of often leaving users
hunting to replace binary third party modules that were now incompatible.
This also left module authors searching through the API change histories to
determine the exact cause for the MMN change and whether their module was
affected.

With the simultaneous release of Apache 2.2-stable and Apache 2.3-development,
the Apache HTTP Server project is moving towards a more predictable stable
release cycle, while allowing forward progress to occur without concern
for breaking the stable branch.  This document explains the rationale between
the two versions and their behavior.


STABLE RELEASES, 2.{even}.{revision}
------------------------------------ 

All even numbered releases will be considered stable revisions. 

Stable revisions will retain forward compatiblity to the maximum
possible extent.  Features may be added during minor revisions, and
features may be deprecated by making appropriate notations in the
documentation, but no features may be removed.

In essence, that implies that you can upgrade from one minor revision
to the next with a minimum of trouble.  In particular, this means:

  * The Module API will retain forward compatibility.
    It will not be necessary to update modules to work with new
    revisions of the stable tree.

  * The run-time configuration will be forward compatible.
    No configuration changes will be necessary to work with new
    revisions of the stable tree.

  * Compile-time configuration will be forward compatible.
    The configure command line options that work in one release
    of the stable tree will also work in the next release.

As always, it will be necessary to test any new release to assure
that it works correctly with a particular configuration and a 
particular set of modules, but every effort will be made to assure
that upgrades are as smooth as possible.

In addition, the following development restrictions will aid in 
keeping the stable tree as safe as possible:

  * No 'Experimental' modules; while it may be possible (based on API changes
    required to support a given module) to load a 2.3-development module into
    a 2.2-stable build of Apache, there are no guarantees.  Experimental 
    modules will be introduced to the 2.3-development versions and either
    added to 2.2-stable once they are proven and compatible, or deferred
    to the 2.4-stable release if they cannot be incorporated in the current
    stable release due to API change requirements.

  * The stable subversion tree should not remain unstable at any time.  Atomic 
    commits ought be used to introduce code from the development version to the 
    stable  tree.  At any given time a security release may be in preparation, 
    unbeknownst to other contributors.  At any given time, testers may be
    checking out SVN trunk to confirm that a bug has been corrected.  And as
    all code was well-tested in development prior to committing to the stable
    tree, there is really no reason for this tree to be broken for more than 
    a few minutes during a lengthy commit.

In order to avoid 'skipped' release numbers in the stable releases, the
Release Manager will generally roll a release candidate (APACHE_#_#_#_RC#)
tag.  Release Candidate tarballs will be announced to the
stable-testers@httpd.apache.org for the stable tree.  Then, the participants
will vote on the quality of the proposed release tarball.

The final APACHE_#_#_# tag will not exist until the APACHE_#_#_#_RC# candidate
has passed the usual votes to release that version.  Only then is the final
tarball packaged, removing all -rc# designations from the version number, and
tagging the tree with the release number.

DEVELOPMENT RELEASES, 2.{odd}.{revision}
-----------------------------------------

All odd numbered releases designate the 'next' possible stable release,
therefore the current development version will always be one greater than
the current stable release.  Work proceeds on development releases, permitting
the modification of the MMN at any time in order to correct deficiencies 
or shortcomings in the API.  This means that modules from one development
release to another may not be binary compatible, or may not successfully
compile without modification to accomodate the API changes.

The only 'supported' development release at any time will be the most
recently released version.  Developers will not be answering bug reports
of older development releases once a new release is available.  It becomes
the resposibility of the reporter to use the latest development version
to confirm that any issue still exists.

Any new code, new API features or new ('experimental') modules may be
promoted at any time to the next stable release, by a vote of the project
contributors.  This vote is based on the technical stability of the new
code and the stability of the interface.  Once moved to stable, that feature
cannot change for the remainder of that stable release cycle, so the vote must
reflect that the final decisions on the behavior and naming of that new
feature were reached.  Vetos continue to apply to this choice of introducing
the new work to the stable version.

At any given time, when the quality of changes to the development branch
is considered release quality, that version may become a candidate for the
next stable release.  This includes some or all of the API changes, promoting
experimental modules to stable or deprecating and eliminating older modules
from the last stable release.  All of these choices are considered by the
project as a group in the interests of promoting the stable release, so that
any given change may be 'deferred' for a future release by the group, rather 
than introduce unacceptable risks to adopting the next stable release.

Third party module authors are strongly encouraged to test with the latest
development version.  This assures that the module will be ready for the next
stable release, but more importantly, the author can react to shortcomings
in the API early enough to warn the dev@httpd.apache.org community of the
shortcomings so that they can be addressed before the stable release.  The
entire burden is on the module author to anticipate the needs of their module
before the stable release is created.  Once a new stable release cycle has
begun, that API will be present for the lifetime of the stable release.  Any
desired changes in the stable versions must wait for inclusion into the next
release cycle.

When deciding to promote a development tree to being stable, a determination
should be made whether the changes since the last stable version warrant a
major version bump.  That is, if 2.2 is the current stable version and 2.3 is
'ready' to become stable, the group needs to decide if the next stable
version is 2.4 or 3.0.  One suggested rule of thumb is that if it requires
too much effort to port a module from 2.2 to 2.4, then the stable version
should be labeled 3.0.

In order to ease the burden of creating development releases, the process
for packaging a development releases is less formal than for the stable
release.  This strategy reflects the fact that while in development, versions
are cheap.  Development releases may be classified as alpha, beta, or GA
to reflect the group's perceived stability of the tree.  Development releases
may be made at any time by any committer.

The GitHub Terms of Service
Effective date: November 16, 2020

A. Definitions
Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.

An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.
"Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).
The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as electronjs.org. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
B. Account Terms
Short version: Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.

1. Account Controls
Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.

Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

2. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

3. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our Export Controls policy.
4. Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the GitHub Support portal if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.
5. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

C. Acceptable Use
Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.

D. User-Generated Content
Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.

1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

2. GitHub May Remove Content
We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.

5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

6. Contributions Under Repository License
Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

8. Access Reciprocity
By using automated means to access, collect, or otherwise use (“Access”) any publicly accessible Content from the Service for the purpose of developing or training any commercially available artificial intelligence model, machine learning system, or similar technology (a "Commercial AI System"), you hereby waive any and all policies, terms, conditions, or contractual provisions governing products, services, websites or datasets you own or operate that would otherwise prohibit, restrict, or place conditions upon GitHub's Access to any publicly accessible data, information or content associated with your products or services, including for the purpose of developing or training any Commercial AI System. You further agree not to impose technical or other targeted measures to restrict or retaliate against such Access.

This Section D.8 does not apply to Access solely for the purpose of academic research or if, on the date you Access the Content, the number of monthly active users of the products or services made available by you is less than 700 million in the preceding calendar month. For the purposes of this Section, "you" shall refer to you and any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you (affiliates).

E. Private Repositories
Short version: We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.

1. Control of Private Repositories
Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories
GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

3. Access
GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

G. Intellectual Property Notice
Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.

1. GitHub's Rights to Content
GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos
If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.

3. License to GitHub Policies
This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.

H. API Terms
Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

I. GitHub Additional Product Terms
Short version: You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.

J. Beta Previews
Short version: Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.

1. Subject to Change
Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.

2. Confidentiality
As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

Confidentiality Obligations. You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

Exceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

3. Feedback
We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

K. Payment
Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.

1. Pricing
Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes
We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.
3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
Payment Based on Plan For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

Payment Based on Usage Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details.

Invoicing For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

4. Authorization
By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

5. Responsibility for Payment
You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the GitHub Support portal. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

L. Cancellation and Termination
Short version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.

1. Account Cancellation
It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

2. Upon Cancellation
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

3. GitHub May Terminate
GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

4. Survival
All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

M. Communications with GitHub
Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.

1. Electronic Communication Required
For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing
Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.

3. No Phone Support
GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

N. Disclaimer of Warranties
Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

O. Limitation of Liability
Short version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
your use or inability to use the Service;
any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
any other matter relating to the Service.
Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

P. Release and Indemnification
Short version: You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

Q. Changes to These Terms
Short version: We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site Policy repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

R. Miscellaneous
1. Governing Law
Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California. However, any claim for injunctive relief with respect to a violation of section D.8 may be brought in any jurisdiction.

2. Non-Assignability
GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the GitHub Privacy Statement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4.

Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

5. Amendments; Complete Agreement
