     ⚠️ This category is solely for discussions and feedback on [the GitHub Discussions product](https://github.com/features/discussions). ⚠️

     The Discussions category is NOT meant to be a place for any old discussion regarding GitHub or programming — [the General category](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/general) is a more appropriate space for misc topics. To ensure you receive a timely response and connect with the proper team(s), please post in the correct category by using the corresponding product category. 

     NOTE: If you post in this category about topics other than GitHub Discussions, your post may be moved or deleted without warning.
