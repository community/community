GitHub loves third party developers. We want to help make your project awesome, and often that includes showing off GitHub integration with an image. In order to keep everyone happy (and avoid involving lawyers), we've created this repository and filled it with artwork that you may use in your own applications.

For help or to add media not included here, please email support@github.com and we'll talk.


THESE THINGS ARE AWESOME, PLEASE DO THEM:

+ Use the Octocat, the Mark, or GitHub logo to link to GitHub

+ Use the Mark, in "social buttons" that link to your GitHub profile or project

+ Use the Octocat, the Mark, or GitHub logo to advertise that your product has built-in GitHub integration

+ Use the Octocat, the Mark or GitHub logo in a blog post or news article about GitHub


PLEASE, DON"T DO THESE THINGS:

- Use the Octocat or GitHub logo for your application's icon

- Create a modified version of the Octocat or GitHub logo

- Integrate the Octocat or GitHub logo into your logo

- Use any GitHub artwork without permission


NAMING YOUR APPLICATION

Please avoid naming your projects anything that implies GitHub's endorsement. For example, don't call your awesome new iPhone app "GitHub Issues". Instead consider "Octoissues" or "HubIssues" or "Gissues". Maybe not that last one, but you get the idea.
