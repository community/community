# GitHub public feedback discussions

In this repository, you can find the [official GitHub public feedback discussions](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions) for the following products:

- [GitHub Mobile](https://github.com/mobile) - [:iphone: Mobile Feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Mobile+Feedback%22)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions) - [:speaking_head: Discussions Feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Discussions+Feedback%22)

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the GitHub product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

This repository works in conjunction with the [GitHub public product roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap), which is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Accordingly, the Issues feature of this repository has been disabled. Discussions here will be limited to the products listed above and corresponding categories. Any discussions opened for other topics will be resolved by redirecting the feedback to the appropriate channel or outright removal in the case of unacceptable behavior per the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/1) if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion reply with additional details or react to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion the GitHub product team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities GitHub doesnâ€™t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we are going to prioritize a feature to solve the problem you've identified we may open an issue and track it's development in the [public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap).
- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
