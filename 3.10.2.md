### Bug Fixes

* When using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, a host check will test the availability of all nodes before running any operations on them and output a warning if a node is unreachable. Previously if a node was unreachable the host check could silently fail. 
* When using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, user permissions assigned to the temporary progress files in `/tmp` have been updated to allow access by other users. Previously, having backup and restore operations performed by different users could cause failed deletion error messages for temporary files. 
* On an instance with Actions enabled, incorrect backup and restore settings prevented the storage container name from being restored. This made the logs from that container inaccessible, and caused Actions to create a new storage container in a different location. 

### Changes

* Adds support for finding the `parallel` command from the `moreutils` tool suite on more Linux distributions, including Arch Linux and Alpine Linux. 

### Backups and Disaster Recovery

When a NFS mount is detected for snapshots on backup hosts, backup logs will show a warning to notify the user that such a setup may incur performance issues as highlighted in [storage requirements](https://github.com/github/backup-utils-private/blob/master/docs/requirements.md#storage-requirements) documentation.
