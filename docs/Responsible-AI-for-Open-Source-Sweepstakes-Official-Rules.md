The entry limit is one entry per challenge (there are three challenges).  

Any attempt by you to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple/different accounts, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will void your entries and you may be disqualified. Use of any automated system to participate is prohibited.  

We are not responsible for excess, lost, late, or incomplete entries. If disputed, entries will be deemed submitted by the “authorized account holder” of the email address, social media account, or other method used to enter. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned to an email address by an internet or online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses.  

### WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION  
Pending confirmation of eligibility, potential prize winners will be selected by Microsoft or their Agent in a random drawing from among all eligible entries received within 7 days following the Entry Period.  

Winners will be notified via the contact information provided during entry no more than 7 days following the drawing with prize claim instructions, including submission deadlines. If a selected winner cannot be contacted, is ineligible, fails to claim a prize or fails to return any forms, the selected winner will forfeit their prize and an alternate winner will be selected time allowing. If you are a potential winner and you are 18 or older but have not reached the age of majority in your legal place of residence, we may require your parent/legal guardian to sign all required forms on your behalf. Only three alternate winners will be selected, after which unclaimed prizes will remain unawarded.

Ten (10) Grand Prizes. Each winner will receive:  
A(n) GitHub Shop voucher. Approximate Retail Value (ARV) $30.00.  

The ARV of electronic prizes is subject to price fluctuations in the consumer marketplace based on, among other things, any gap in time between the date the ARV is estimated for purposes of these Official Rules and the date the prize is awarded or redeemed. We will determine the value of the prize to be the fair market value at the time of prize award.  

The total Approximate Retail Value (ARV) of all prizes: $300  

We will only award one (1) prize per person/company during the Entry Period. No more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded.

This is so even if the Microsoft product mentions a warranty on its packaging, in a manual, or in marketing materials; no warranty applies to Microsoft products awarded as prizes.  

Microsoft does not give any warranty of any kind, express or implied (including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) on products made by a company other than Microsoft that are awarded as prizes. Please contact the manufacturer to see if it is covered by that company’s warranty.
