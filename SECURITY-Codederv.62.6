## Reporting a Vulnerability
Hi @mikelartz,
Yes, we are using cyclonedx-dotnet. I have investigated further and look like it's a bug in cyclonedx-dotnet.
Sample solution with two projects look like below and attached to the thread.

Observations:

When I generate BOM for entire solution using dotnet CycloneDX -o . -j BOMIssue.sln following dependency is added to BOM.
{ "ref": "pkg:nuget/NServiceBus.Newtonsoft.Json@2.3.0", "dependsOn": [ "pkg:nuget/NServiceBus@7.3.0", "pkg:nuget/Newtonsoft.Json@11.0.2" ] },

When I generate BOM only for using dotnet CycloneDX -o . -j BOMIssue/BOMIssue.csproj following dependency is added to BOM.

{ "ref": "pkg:nuget/**NServiceBus.Newtonsoft.Json@2.3.0**", "dependsOn": [ "pkg:nuget/NServiceBus@7.0.0", "pkg:nuget/**Newtonsoft.Json@13.0.1**" ] },

I think tool is reporting incorrect dependency of NServiceBus.Newtonsoft.Json@2.3.0 on Newtonsoft.Json@11.0.2. In fact IdentityModel@4.1.1 is depending on Newtonsoft.Json@11.0.2.

Could you please investigate further?
