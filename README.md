# Fennel Community Discussions

In this repository, you will find categories for various product areas. Feel free to share new ideas.

## Product Feedback

<!-- | **Feedback Category** |
|---	|
| ðŸ“± [Mobile](https://github.com/orgs/fennelmarkets/discussions/categories/mobile) | -->

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the Fennel product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/fennelmarkets/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. 

Prior to creating a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already shared your suggestion(s). If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new one.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the Fennel product team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities Fennel doesnâ€™t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
